Prototype:
    -Blueprint of data that objects are created from
    -Similar to classes
    -Every prototype inherits from the original prototypes
        1. These includes Array.prototype , Object.prototype , Function.prototype
        2. Each one of these has inherent methods, eg. toString, split, etc
        3. You can overwride built in toString method by doing this ...
            Code Snippet: 
            newArr = [1,2,3];
            str = newArr.toString();
            console.log(newArr); // to string method will turn it into a string

            Array.prototype.toString = function (){
            return "The string method has been changed";
            }

            console.log(newArr.toString) // The to string method has been changed

Objects:
    - Objects can be created via literal or class blueprint
    - When using literals, then you dont have to create an instance of it
    - When using classes you have to use the new keyword and call on the constructor
